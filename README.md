2024-2025 SAU GameDev Senior Project. I worked as the Design Lead on this project helping form the pitch, creating a design doc, scoping our project and helping road map our plan. I also programmed the player movement, camera system, and controller support as well as helping with the combat system and creating our enemy encounters and levels.

## Crown of Screws

A Submission to the 8th annual LATech University Game Jam where it won the awards Best Overall and Developers Choice. I helped come up with our core concept to fit into the theme of our jam and our scope. I programmed the player movement, the player and enemy shooting, and implemented the background music. I also set up the barriers so the player canâ€™t leave the map, helped come up with our power up concepts and made the tutorial.
