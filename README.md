A Submission to the 8th annual LATech University Game Jam where it won the awards Best Overall and Developers Choice. I helped come up with our core concept to fit into the theme of our jam and our scope. I programmed the player movement, the player and enemy shooting, and implemented the background music. I also set up the barriers so the player canâ€™t leave the map, helped come up with our power up concepts and made the tutorial.

2023 SAU Game Studio Workshop game. I created and pitched the initial idea for the project. Worked as its Design Lead writing a design doc, creating a list of the required animation for the character, wrote out the movesets and helped balance the game. I programmed the unique charge mechanic, the walls that stop the player from leaving the arena and decided damage numbers, knockback and how fast attacks were.
