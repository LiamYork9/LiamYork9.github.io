![BlightsGrasp](BlightGrasp2.png)

2024-2025 SAU GameDev Senior Project. On this team of 12 I was the Design Lead for this project helping form the pitch, creating a design doc, scoping our project and helping road map our plan. I also programmed the player movement, camera system, and controller support as well as helping with the combat system and creating our enemy encounters and levels. I worked on our steam page and achieved our release deadline of 4/29/25.

June 2025 Pre early access launch. I worked as a designer on this project and worked on the game balance and flow. Tested and tweaked all the towers, enemies and levels to see how they felt, adjusting all kinds of values from enemy speed to how much damage a tower deals.

## Crown of Screws
![Crown of Screws](Crown.png)

A Submission to the 8th annual LATech University Game Jam where it won the awards Best Overall and Developers Choice. I helped come up with our core concept to fit into the theme of our jam and our scope. I programmed the player movement, the player and enemy shooting, and implemented the background music. I also set up the barriers so the player canâ€™t leave the map, helped come up with our power up concepts and made the tutorial.

## Analog Brawl

2023 SAU Game Studio Workshop game. This project had a team size of 13. I created and pitched the initial idea for the project. Worked as its Design Lead writing a design doc, creating a list of the required animation for the character, wrote out the movesets and helped balance the game. I programmed the unique charge mechanic, the walls that stop the player from leaving the arena and decided damage numbers, knockback and how fast attacks were.
